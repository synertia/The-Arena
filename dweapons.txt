Short Sword	8	6	He has a short sword that allows some reach, but may not be enough.

Long Sword	12	8	He is holding a long sword with an edge and a point allowing large tactical variety in the right hands.
Curved Sword	15	9	The sword he is holding is long and curved in the style of the eastern warriors. This allows fast and quick cutting to defeat the opponent.
