<h1>The-Arena</h1>
<h3>by Will Owens</h3>
The Arena is a small betting game used to practice object oriented programming in Python.

The game is very simple in that the player has a sack full of money and has the chance to bet on two randomly generated gladiators. All names and equipment are generated from text files that may be altered to increase the playability of the game. However, several selectors, such as those that check strength and dexterity and choose within a certain range of the list restrict this, but these may be adjusted. I am also thinking of a better way to make expansion easier.
